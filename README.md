# README

A simple TODO headless Rails API based on:
https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-json-api-with-rails-5-part-one#toc-conclusion

Start the server with `rails s`.<br>
Run the tests with `bundle exec rspec`.<br>

I finished part 1 and then stopped. When I get some free time I'd like to explore the rest of this series.
